Updated 2021 version of data set posted to accompany

morphology of Achilles tendon in runners” from figshare.

\details{
Note that data are as posted but variable names are manipulated in help to provide
variable names and coding that are more compatible with R.

For VISA-A: "The maximum score that can be achieved on the question is 100,
and would be the score of person who is completely asymptomatic.
A lower score indicates more symptoms and greater limitation of physical activity.
A recreational person who has Achilles tendinopathy will not score higher than 70
on the VISA-A scale." - From https://www.physio-pedia.com/VISA-A_scale

"Subject ID" = identifier includes site info (two observations per subject typically)
"Side" = Leg levels of Left/Right
"PSFR" = See paper, main response variable related to intra-tendinous morphology, units: mm^-1, average of 3 scans
"HeelRaise" = Count of heel raise endurance test
"KneeWall" = knee-to-wall composite dorsiflexion test (a weight-bearing lunge test of composite ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, as described by Hoch and Mckeon)
"CurrPain (Y=1)" = current pain (in either/measured ankle? - check)
"Neovascularization (Doppler) (Y=1)" = ?
"VISA-A" = Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment—Achilles score
"Age" = Age in years
"Sex  (M=1)" (53 males, 38 females in study)
"YearsRunning" = Years running (years)
"BMI"
"Waist to Hip" = waist to hip ratio
"CSA" = tendon gross morphology (average of three scans)
"Hx Pain (Y=1)" = history of ankle/achilles pain
